      <description>You can find all the notes (incomplete ones and lab notes included) uploaded here - link&#xA;Mid Semester Merged Notes I only have these notes complete, here they are -&#xA;PH2201: Basic Quantum Mechanics PH2202: Thermal Physics Adrika&amp;rsquo;s Notes for LS2202 Typed up notes These will only be updated until I realise I should just stop and study Analysis instead (I need to pass).&#xA;PH2202: Thermal Physics PH2201: Basic Quantum Mechanics </description>

      <description>I plan on collecting all the cool sites that I find, related to Physics of course, here.&#xA;K. McDonald&amp;rsquo;s Physics Examples: A rich, old-internet site with myriad resources pertaining to physics. PSE: Book Recommendations: Physics StackExhange&amp;rsquo;s very own list of recommended books and resources. In The Dark: Cute Problems: A very nice little blog with some nice questions. Tong Lectures: The David Tong lecture notes. Wolfram ScienceWorld: A cool website with a lot of historical information.</description>

      <description>Introduction We start off by taking as a prototype the simple Newtonian scheme of a point particle of mass $m$ moving along the x-axis under a potential field $V(x)$.&#xA;According to Newton&amp;rsquo;s Second Law of motion, $$ m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = - \frac{dV}{dx} $$&#xA;If we are given the position and the velocity of this particle at some initial time, i.e. $x(t_i)$ and $\dot{x}(t_i)$, then it is possible for us to compute the classical trajectory of the particle $x_{cl}(t)$ as follows $$ x_{cl}(t+\Delta t) = x(t_i) + \dot{x}(t_i) \Delta t $$</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my 4th semester.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in Physics (like almost everybody here). I find simulations of physical phenomena using computational methods very interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to learn more about how such methods are used in Physics. I also like bubbles! Here is work I did on them.&#xA;I love tinkering with electronics - making small (and mostly useless) circuits, burning holes in my table with a soldering iron along the way.</description>

      <description>A collection of online (and offline) resources that, in my opinion, are ideal for anyone who wishes to start tinkering. The list is continually being updated as I encounter good resources out there in the wild.&#xA;General Websites Reference for guided tutorials, theory, project ideas, and news pertinent to the hobbyist electronics community.&#xA;Electronics-Tutorial : Simple, clean tutorial site. The topics are not arranged in an ideal sequence, in my opinion, but it is still a great first reference.</description>
