A collection of online (and offline) resources that, in my opinion, are ideal for anyone who wishes to start tinkering. The list is continually being updated as I encounter good resources out there in the wild.

# General Websites
Reference for guided tutorials, theory, project ideas, and news pertinent to the hobbyist electronics community.

* [Electronics-Tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/) : Simple, clean tutorial site. The topics are not arranged in an ideal sequence, in my opinion, but it is still a great first reference.

* [Sparkfun Learn](https://learn.sparkfun.com/) : A pretty exhaustive list of tutorials (and in general, information) regarding the myriad modules you can get for the Arduino ecosystem.

* [All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/) : Framed like a textbook (technically, it **is** one), it is an excellent learning resource for beginners. Their [blog](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/) is pretty technical, but you can find useful/interesting stuff on it.

* [electronicstheory.com](http://electronicstheory.com/COURSES/ELECTRONICS/e101-1.htm) : A very old, and respected, site on electronics theory up to an intermediate level.

* [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/circuits/) : Always a good source for project ideas.

* [EEVblog](https://www.eevblog.com/) : Best blog out there for all things EE.

* [Electrical4U](https://www.electrical4u.com/electrical-engineering-articles/digital-electronics/) : Informative articles.

* [Arduino Docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/) : Something you should have in your bookmarks if you work with Arduinos. Well written, and concise.

# Communities
Communities are a great way to get involved with electronics as a hobby.

* [/r/AskElectronics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/wiki/beginners/) : For those of you out there who are familiar with Reddit, r/AskElectronics is a very good community to get started in.

* [Electronics StackExchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) : Ask questions here, if Reddit is not your thing (and I don't blame you if it isn't).

# Video Resources

* [GreatScott's Electronic Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAROrg3NQn7cyu01HpOv5BWo217XWBZu0) : If video tutorials are your thing, GreatScott's Electronic Basics is an excellent place to start. You might want to check out his YT Channel in general, it has great stuff.

* [Afrotechmods](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosnWgi3eorc1klEQ8pIgJQ) : Though he hasn't put out any new videos/blog posts in over 5 years, Afrotechmods' YT channel and website remain excellent references.

# Books

You'll find me hoarding these books at the Library most of the time, but I'm willing to share.

* *The Art of Electronics* - Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill: Highly recommended read. Our library has a copy, [here](http://lib.iiserkol.ac.in:8080/lib/item?id=chamo:7869&theme=iiserk).

* *Electronic Principles* - Albert Paul Malvino, David J. Bates: Standard textbook on all things electronics - and for good reason. Library copy [here](http://lib.iiserkol.ac.in:8080/lib/item?id=chamo:808&theme=iiserk).

* *Digital Computer Electronics* - Albert Paul Malvino, Jerald A. Brown: Library copy [here](http://lib.iiserkol.ac.in:8080/lib/item?id=chamo:2121&theme=iiserk).

* *Practical Electronics Handbook* - Ian R. Sinclair, John Dunton: The library has a [copy](http://lib.iiserkol.ac.in:8080/lib/item?id=chamo:3362&theme=iiserk), but I haven't been able to track it down yet :(

* *Electronics: A Physical Approach* - David W. Snoke: Excellent read, also highly recommended.

# Arduino specific

If you ask me, the best way to start is to just get yourself and [Arduino kit](https://www.amazon.in/arduino-kit/s?k=arduino+kit), go on Instructables, decide on some project (doesn't matter if it looks complicated, it just needs to interest you) and, well, **just start**.
In my experience, you always learn this stuff faster if you build it yourself instead of just reading the theory.

# More to come!
I'll be adding websites, YT channels, books, and other resources as I come across them. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:ds22ms038@iiserkol.ac.in) with any suggestions!
Looking forward to an active hobbyist electronics community on campus :)
