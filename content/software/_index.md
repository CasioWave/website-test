![RICE!](/images/rice.png)

I have distro-hopped once again, this time to Arch (btw). It's nice, clean, and it just works! After you have spent the better half of a week fiddling with it, that is.
I'm using [EndeavourOS](endeavouros.com), with [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) as my DE. My rice is thanks to the well documented dotfiles and scripts from [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4).
