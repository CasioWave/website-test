![RICE!](/images/rice.jpeg)

After years of aimless distro-hopping, I have finally settled on using [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/) with [qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) as my DE - I will probably be using this setup until GNU Hurd Stable release drops (-_-).
This rice exists due to DistroTube's well documented [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles), and my ongoing obsession with [pixel art](https://www.pixilart.com/casiowave).
