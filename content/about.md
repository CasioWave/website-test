I'm currently in my **4th** semester.

I'm mostly interested in Physics (like almost everybody here). I find simulations of physical phenomena using computational methods very interesting, and I'm currently trying to learn more about how such methods are used in Physics. I also like bubbles! [Here](https://github.com/CasioWave/bubble-avalanche) is work I did on them.

I love tinkering with electronics - making small (and mostly useless) circuits, burning holes in my table with a soldering iron along the way. I'm learning how to play the guitar and the bass (not really).

I also enjoy quizzing a lot - I keep uploading the sets that I make.

I love listening to music, and I will listen to anything obscure enough to make me feel like a special snowflake.
I use Linux (Arch, btw) as my daily driver, and I often waste away hours of my day trying to get my configs *just* right. Long Live Linus!
